 *
 *  I could have probably written this code to be a little more generically but I struggled
 *  with abstracting the hardware layer. Instead, I opted for layering objects so they "connect"
 *  logically in the software as they do in real life.  You command the software object the
 *  way you want to command it, and that object then in turn knows how to relay that command
 *  to its physical self through its first uplink.
 *
 *  For instance, I connect to my ESC like this:
 *
 *  Raspberry Pi >> I2C bus >> PCA9685 PWM controller >> channel 9 >> ESC
 *
 *  I guess you could plug the ESC straight into a Raspberry Pi PWM pin or you could use
 *  an SPI controller instead.  The point is that as long as you maintain a simple interface,
 *  you should be able to adjust the configuration with minimal changes.
 *
 *  I have also struggled a little bit with the 'channel' value that I have assigned to this
 *  configuration.  In principle, which channel the ESC is connected to is a function of the
 *  controller rather than the ESC itself.  However, I didn't want to implement pwm controllers
 *  for each channels right now to keep it simple so it's a quirk that will probably have to be
 *  solved later.
 *
 *  If you are editing this on a platform that does not have the wiringPi libraries loaded, you will
 *  see errors in the code.  That is normal.  I compile on the raspberry pi directly and it works.

/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * CONSTRUCTOR
 * initializes the ESC (if the PWM controller has already been initialized)
 * Receives:
 * 		-	A PwmEscConfig* that should contain the user-set values to determine the PWM values
 * 			to send the controller to achieve various tasks.  That configuration will be saved as
 * 			the base configuration.  PwmEscConfig is a struct defined in PwmEsc.h.
 *
 *			The base configuration needs to be adjusted based on the actual PWM controller
 * 			configuration because PWM controllers can take different forms:  At the end of the day
 * 			a typical ESC will be on neutral with a 1.5ms pulse, full reverse with a 1ms pulse and
 * 			full forward with a 2ms pulse. (Same for most servos)
 *
 * 			The PCA9685 controller that I use can be set to different pulse frequencies, which changes
 * 			the size of the of the frame width (50Hz creates 20ms frames but at 100Hz your frames
 * 			are 10ms).
 *
 * 			It also offers a 12-bit resolution, which means that the pwm values you can send range
 * 			from 0 to 4095.
 *
 * 			That means that at 50Hz, with frames that are 20ms wide, a pulse value of 1 represents
 * 			a 1/4096 of 20ms, which is 4.88 micro seconds.  The value required to send a 1ms pulse
 * 			should therefore be 4096 (resolution) / 20ms = 204.8 (205).
 *
 * 			Based on that, I know that my neutral position (1.5ms) should be ~308.  If I were to change
 * 			my frequency to 100Hz, however, the neutral value would be 616!
 *
 * 			This is why the PwmEsc object takes a base configuration from the instantiator, and then
 * 			adjusts its own internal configuration based on the actual frequency of the controller.
 *
 * 			This is also why it is highly recommended to send speed requests using percentages rather
 * 			than straight PWM values.
 *
 * 			ALSO IMPORTANT, because the vehicle has a certain weight and the motor driven by the ESC
 * 			can respond in different ways, there is a Min value for forward and reverse values that
 * 			really needs to be set based on your own vehicle.  For instance, my neutral seems to be
 * 			at 335 (instead of theoretical 308) but then it takes until 357 for the car to even
 * 			start moving forward.  Values from 335 to 357 are lost.  So, when you calculate the %
 * 			thrust you send to the motor, the range from 0 to 100% should not be mapped to 335 (neutral)
 * 			to 450 (my max forward), but rather from 357 (min forward) to 450 (max forward).
 *
 * 		-	and PCA9685* pointing to the PCA9685 PWM controller in use.  I struggled a little bit with
 * 			this one.  Ideally, you should really take a generic 'pwm controller' object offering a
 * 			standard interface and then implement the PCA9685 using that interface but a few things
 * 			happened:
 * 			1)	I am still experimenting and not ready to solidify a generic interface when I am not
 * 				100% sure of how this should work as a final product
 * 			2)	I hadn't touched c++ in 20 years and I am still catching up and refreshing my memory
 * 			3)	I got lazy and just wanted to see those wheels spin on that car :)
